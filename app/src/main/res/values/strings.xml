            MENSTRUAL CYCLE ESSAY
              <br> \n</br>
            <br> \n</br>

Describe the menstrual cycle and how it is influenced by different hormones??

            <br> \n</br>
            <br> \n</br>
*The menstrual cycle is a series of events that occur in the female body to
prepare it for possible pregnancy
            <br> \n</br>
            <br> \n</br>

*Which involves ovarian cycle
and the uterine cycle
            <br> \n</br>
            <br> \n</br>
*It takes an average of 28 days
            <br> \n</br>
            <br> \n</br>
*The pituitary gland hypophysis
secretes FSH
which stimulates the development of a primary follicle in the ovary
            <br> \n</br>
            <br> \n</br>
*The developing follicle /Graafan follicle
secretes oestrogen
which stimulates the thickening of the lining of the uterus/endometrium
            <br> \n</br>
            <br> \n</br>
*Around day 13 pituitary gland hypophysis
secretes LH
which cause ovulation to occur
            <br> \n</br>
            <br> \n</br>
*The remains of the Graafian follicle develops into the corpus luteum
which secretes the progesterone
which continues to stimulate the thickening of the uterus
            <br> \n</br>
            <br> \n</br>
*High levels of progesterone
inhibits the production of FSH
so that the ovaries are no longer stimulated to produce another follicle
            <br> \n</br>
            <br> \n</br>
*If fertilisation does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates
and stops producing progesterone
            <br> \n</br>
            <br> \n</br>
*The pituitary gland/hypophysis is no longer inhibited in its production of
FSH and a new follicle develops
            <br> \n</br>
            <br> \n</br>
*The thick endometrium is no longer maintained / it degenerates
and is shed together with blood menstruation takes place
            <br> \n</br>
            <br> \n</br>
            <br> \n</br>

        <item>FORELIMBS MODIFICATION AND FUNCTIONS ESSAY<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
Charles Darwin’s explanation for the differences in the structures of the forelimbs<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
Forelimbs of mammals are built on the same pattern but have different functions. Study the
diagram of FIVE mammals and write a mini-essay where you discuss the modification and
functions of their forelimbs. Include in your discussion Charles Darwin’s explanation for the
differences in the structures of the forelimbs of the five mammals although they are built on
the same pattern.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

            *The Bat<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• The forelimbs have become wings for flying.<br> \n</br>
• The first digit is hook-like to hang from trees<br> \n</br>
• while the last four digits have become elongated to make up the wing<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*The monkey<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• The forelimbs are very long<br> \n</br>
• to allow it to grasp trees while it is climbing<br> \n</br>
• and swinging<br> \n</br>
*The mole<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Has a pair of short, spade-like forelimbs<br> \n</br>
• that are modified for digging<br> \n</br>
*The seal<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• The forelimbs have become flippers<br> \n</br>
• for steering and<br> \n</br>
• maintaining equilibrium during swimming.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*The horse<br> \n</br>
• The forelimbs are adapted for support<br> \n</br>
• and running with the third digit being very elongated ending in a hoof<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Charles Darwin’s explanation:<br> \n</br>
• Forelimbs of mammals arose from a common ancestor<br> \n</br>
• in which the forelimb had the same pattern.<br> \n</br>
• The forelimbs of the five mammals show variations<br> \n</br>
• because of having been modified<br> \n</br>

        <item>MUTATION ON PROTEIN SYTHESIS AND EVOLUTION ESSAY<br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
Describe how a gene mutation may influence the structure of a protein. Also use ONE example
to describe the role of mutations in evolution in present times<br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*MUTATIONS AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS<br> \n</br>
• A mutation is a change in the nucleotide/nitrogenous base sequence<br> \n</br>
• of a DNA molecule/a gene<br> \n</br>
• since mRNA is copied from the DNA molecule<br> \n</br>
• during transcription<br> \n</br>
• This will result in a change in the codons<br> \n</br>
• As a result, different tRNA molecules<br> \n</br>
• carrying different amino acid will be required<br> \n</br>
• The sequence of amino acids changes<br> \n</br>
• resulting in the formation of a different protein<br> \n</br>
• If the same amino acid is coded for<br> \n</br>
• there will be no change in the protein structure <br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*MUTATIONS AND EVOLUTION IN PRESENT TIMES<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• In a population of insects/bacteria/HI viruses/Galápagos finches <br> \n</br>
            - mutations are a
source of variation<br> \n</br>
• which may make some organisms more resistant/better suited<br> \n</br>
• to insecticides/antibiotics/antiretroviral medication/ drought<br> \n</br>
• Those individuals that are not resistant/suited will die<br> \n</br>
• whereas - those that are resistant/ well suited, will survive<br> \n</br>
• to pass the resistant allele/resistance on to their offspring<br> \n</br>
• This is known as natural selection<br> \n</br>
• As a result, individuals of the future generations will be resistant to the
insecticides/antibiotics/antiretroviral medication/adapted to drought</item>
        <item> ACCOMODATION, HEARING AND BALANCE ESSAY<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
A goalkeeper in a soccer match prevented a goal from being scored when he dived to his right
after the ball was kicked towards him. Just before he dived, he heard his team-mate shout,
(your ball).<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
Describe how his eyes adjusted to see the ball as it travelled towards him and describe how he
heard his team-mate and maintained his balance as he dived to save the ball.
As the ball moved towards the goalkeeper:<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Accommodation took place<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Ciliary muscles contracted<br> \n</br>
• Suspensory ligaments became slack<br> \n</br>
• This reduced the tension on lens<br> \n</br>
• Lens became more convex/round<br> \n</br>
• Refractive power of the lens increased<br> \n</br>
• Image of the ball fell on the retina <br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Hearing The shout of his team-mate was heard by the goal keeper as follows:<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• The sound waves were directed by the pinn<br> \n</br>
• through the auditory canal<br> \n</br>
• to the tympanic membrane/eardrum<br> \n</br>
• causing it to vibrate<br> \n</br>
• The vibrations of the tympanic membrane were transferred to the ossicles<br> \n</br>
• in the middle ear - which eventually caused the oval window to vibrate<br> \n</br>
• This set up pressure waves in the cochlea<br> \n</br>
• This stimulated the Organ of Curti the cochlea<br> \n</br>
• to convert this stimulus into a nerve impulse<br> \n</br>
• which was then transmitted along the auditory nerve<br> \n</br>
• and interpreted in the cerebrum <br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Balance and equilibrium As he dived:<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• A change in the direction and speed of the body<br> \n</br>
• causes the movement of fluid in the semicircular canals<br> \n</br>
• which stimulates the cristae<br> \n</br>
• A change in the position of the head<br> \n</br>
• stimulated the maculae<br> \n</br>
• in the utriculus and sacculus<br> \n</br>
• The stimuli were converted into impulses<br> \n</br>
• which were transported along the auditory nerve<br> \n</br>
• and interpreted in the cerebellum<br> \n</br>
• which then sent impulses to the muscles<br> \n</br>
• to restore balance and equilibrium</item>
        <item>MEIOSIS, MUTATION AND NATURAL SELECTION ESSAY<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
Describe how meiosis and different types of mutations contribute to genetic variation and the
role of this variation in natural selection.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Meiosis<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Crossing over occurs during prophase I<br> \n</br>
• Homologous chromosomes / chromatids overlap<br> \n</br>
• at points called chiasma/ chiasmata<br> \n</br>
• Genetic material is exchanged<br> \n</br>
• resulting in new combinations of genetic material<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Random arrangement of chromosomes<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• occurs during metaphase<br> \n</br>
• so that they separate in a random/ independent manner<br> \n</br>
• resulting in new combinations of genetic material<br> \n</br>
*Mutations<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• A gene/ (point and frameshift) mutation occurs<br> \n</br>
• as a result of a change in sequence of nitrogen bases<br> \n</br>
• in the DNA molecule<br> \n</br>
• A chromosome mutation occurs as a<br> \n</br>
• result of a change in the structure of a chromosome/ number of chromosomes during
meiosis<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Mutations that occur in sex cells<br> \n</br>
• are passed on to the new generations<br> \n</br>
• creating new characteristics<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Role of variation in natural selection<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Organisms of a particular species shows a great deal of variation<br> \n</br>
• Some individuals may have characteristics that are favourable/ any example<br> \n</br>
• Others may have characteristics/any example that are unfavourable<br> \n</br>
• If there is competition/changing environmental conditions/ Selective pressure by
the environment<br> \n</br>
• organisms with favourable characteristics survive<br> \n</br>
• and reproduce<br> \n</br>
• and pass these favourable characteristics to their offspring<br> \n</br>
• while organisms with unfavourable characteristics will die out<br> \n</br>
• Over time the whole population will have this favourable characteristic</item>
        <item>ADRENALIN AND HEARING ESSAY<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
While walking in the bush Paul hears a sound which he thinks is the roar of a lion. He
immediately runs to safety.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
Describe how he hears the sound and describe the role of adrenalin to ensure that his muscles
are able to function efficiently while he runs away.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Hearing<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Pinna traps/directs the sound waves<br> \n</br>
• Into the ear canal/meatus<br> \n</br>
• This causes the tympanic membrane to vibrate<br> \n</br>
• The vibration is transmitted to the auditory ossicles<br> \n</br>
• The ossicles amplify the vibration<br> \n</br>
• and transmit it to the oval window<br> \n</br>
• The oval window vibrates<br> \n</br>
• creating waves<br> \n</br>
• in the fluid/endolymph of the cochlea<br> \n</br>
• which stimulates the Organ of Corti<br> \n</br>
• to convert the wave into an impulse<br> \n</br>
• The impulse travels along the auditory nerve<br> \n</br>
• to the cerebrum<br> \n</br>
• where it is interpreted as the roar of the lion<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Role of Adrenalin<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• More adrenalin is secreted<br> \n</br>
• Adrenalin increases muscle tone<br> \n</br>
• And causes the liver/muscles to convert glycogen into glucose<br> \n</br>
• The heart rate increases<br> \n</br>
• so that the muscles receive more glucose<br> \n</br>
• and oxygen<br> \n</br>
• needed for cellular respiration<br> \n</br>
• to provide the energy<br> \n</br>
• for the muscles to contract efficiently<br> \n</br>
• The rate of breathing increases<br> \n</br>
• and the depth of breathing increases<br> \n</br>
• to exhale carbon dioxide from the muscles faster<br> \n</br>
• and inhale oxygen faster<br> \n</br>
• Constriction of blood vessels to the gut/skin<br> \n</br>
• and dilation of blood vessels to the vital organs/brain/muscles<br> \n</br>
• allowing more blood to be supplied to vital organs/brain/muscles </item>

State the (Out Of Africa)  hypothesis. Describe the evidence that supports the (Out Of Africa)
hypothesis and the evidence that shows that the three primate genera mentioned above, were
all bipedal<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*HYPOTHESIS<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• All modern humans*/Homo sapiens<br> \n</br>

        <item>NATURAL SELECTION AND SPECIATION ESSAY<br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
The anole lizard of the Caribbean Islands represents a group of about 150 closely relate
species, which evolved within the past 50 million years from a single species.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
Use this example to describe how natural selection led to the process of speciation that gave
rise to the 150 different species of lizards.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Natural selection and speciation<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• The original species of anole lizards was separated<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Into different populations<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• by a geographical barrier<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• which is the sea<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• There was no gene flow<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• between the separated populations<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Each population was exposed to different environmental conditions<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• on each island<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Because there is variation<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• amongst the lizards<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Natural selection occurred independently<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• in each population<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Some had favourable characteristics<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• to survive on a specific island<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• while others did not<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• The ones that did not have the favourable characteristics died<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• The ones with the favourable characteristic survived<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• and reproduced to pass the gene for the favourable characteristics<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• to the next generation<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• And over many generations the favourable characteristic becomes more frequent in the
population<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• each population became different from the other<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

        <item>SPERMATOGENESIS ESSAY<br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
Sperm is produced, transported and then combined with secretions from the accessory glands
to form semen. The semen is then transferred into the body of the female where it meets the
ovum.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
Describe all the processes referred to in the statement above and explain THREE structural
adaptations of the sperm for fertilisation<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Spermatogenesis<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Takes place under the influence of testosterone<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• in the seminiferous tubules/testis<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

• prostate gland and<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Cowpers glands<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• fluids are added that provide nutrition,<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• promote the movement of the sperm<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• and neutralise the acids<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• produced in the vagina<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• The semen passes through the urethra<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

• and swims up the Fallopian tube<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• where it meets the ovum<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Structural suitability of the sperm cell for fertilisation<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• The acrosome<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• contains enzymes to dissolve a path into the ovum<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Nucleus of the sperm<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• carries genetic material of the male/haploid number of chromosomes<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Many mitochondria<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• in the middle piece - release energy<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• so that sperms could swim<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• The presence of a tailenables sperm cells to swim<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• towards the ovum<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• The contents of the sperm cell such as the cytoplasm is reduced/condensed<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• - making the sperm light for efficient movement<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Sperm is streamlined<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

        <item>DNA REPLICATION AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS ESSAY<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
Each somatic cell in the human body contains identical DNA. This DNA controls the synthesis of
all proteins required for the structure and functioning of the human body. Describe how DNA
controls protein synthesis with the assistance of other nucleic acids found in the human cell.
Also describe how DNA is replicated before the start of cell division to ensure that all body cells
contain identical genetic information.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Protein synthesis<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
Transcription<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• DNA double helix unwinds<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• weak hydrogen bonds of DNA break<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• forming two single strands of DNA<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• One strand acts as template<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• to form a complementary strand which is mRNA / (A – U; G – C )<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• using free RNA nucleotides from the nucleoplasm<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Three adjacent bases on mRNA make up a codon<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• which codes for an amino acid.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• mRNA moves out of the nucleus<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

• weak hydrogen bonds between nitrogenous bases break<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• and the two DNA strands unzip/separate<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Each original DNA strand serves as template to form a new strand<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• by attaching to free nucleotides from nucleoplasm<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• to form complementary strands<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Each DNA molecule now consists of one original strand and one new strand.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

        <item>GENETIC VARIATION ESSAY<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
Describe the mechanisms that cause variation within a species.
Sources of genetic variation:<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Meiosis<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Gametes produced by meiosis are different because of:<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• crossing over during first prophase<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• random arrangement of chromosomes<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• during first metaphase<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• and second metaphase<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Random mating as a source of variation<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• In humans and some other mammals, mating takes place between individuals who<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
select mating partners of a particular kind.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• In most other species, mating takes place randomly amongst all individuals within the<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
population / more than one mating partner<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Chance fertilisation of egg cells by sperm cells<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Usually more than one egg cell and sperm cells are produced<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• and these are all different.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Fusion of many types of sperm cells and egg cells<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• can produce many different types of offspring.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Mutations<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Mutations are sudden, random changes in the genetic code of an organism<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• A gene mutation occurs<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• as a result of a change in the sequence of nitrogen bases in the DNA molecule<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• can result in the formation of a different protein<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

        <item>PETRIFIED FOSSILS ESSSAYS<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
Describe how petrified fossils are formed in sedimentary rock and give examples of fossils
found in places other than rock. Explain how scientists date these fossils and how fossil tourism
can be an advantage to the country<br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Fossil formation<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Dead organisms settle to the bottom of lakes, sea and swamps (body of water).<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Mineral salts in the water also settle to the bottom.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Soft body parts decay leaving only bones.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Mineral salts filter into the bones of organism.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Turning it into stone / this is called petrification.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Layers of sediment are deposited on top over the years.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• As the layers pile up, their weight presses down on the older ones which turn into rock.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Alternatively, the bones may completely decay leaving a cast of the organism.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• The void left behind may then fill with minerals making a stone replica of the organism.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Other types of fossils<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Fossils found in ice e.g. mammoth<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Fossils found in tar e.g. sabre-toothed tiger<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• unaltered fossils<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Fossils trapped in amber/resin e.g. insects<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Carbonised fossils e.g. coal<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Dating fossils<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Radiometric dating Attempts to find out how long ago a particular fossil was formed /
gives the real age of the fossil.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Scientists observe the breakdown of radioactive substances in the rock / breakdown of
radioactive carbon-14/uranium/potassium etc.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• They compare the amount of radioactive substance remaining<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• to the substance it has broken down into / carbon-14 to nitrogen-14/ uranium to lead /
potassium to argon.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Relative dating the age of the fossil is worked out by comparing to the age of another
fossil or geological event.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• It can only tell us whether a particular fossil was formed before or after a particular
fossil or event<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Fossils found in lower layers were formed before/are older than fossils found in an upper
layer.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Advantages of fossil tourism<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Creates employment / job opportunities for the local community e.g. field workers for
digs, tour guides, sculptures and artists<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Creates business opportunities e.g. selling curios.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Education of locals and visitors about our geological history.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Improves the economy of the country as foreign tourists bring more cash.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Money gained through fossil tourism can be used to carry out further excavation.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Fossil sites will be protected as they are a source of income.</item>

A marathon runner took only 1 litre of water with him when he set off on a race on a hot day.
Describe the changes in his body to try to maintain normal body temperature. Describe the role
of the hypothalamus in regulating the water balance of his body<br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Thermoregulation<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• When environmental temperature is high<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Receptors in the skin detects this<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Impulses are send to the Hypothalamus<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Which sent impulses to the blood vessels in the skin<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• These blood vessels become wider/dilate/increase in diameter/vasodilation<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• More blood flows through the skin<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• More heat is therefore lost<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• from the body - Through radiation<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• The sweat glands<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Produce more sweat<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• That evaporates from the skin’s surface<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Leading to more heat is lost<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Cooling down the body<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Hypothalamus<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• will respond to information received from osmoreceptors<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• To release more ADH into the blood<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Higher concentration of ADH increases the permeability<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• of the renal tubules/distal convoluted and collecting tubules<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Allowing more water to be reabsorbed from the filtrate<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Passing into the surrounding blood capillaries<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
• Increasing the quantity of water in the blood<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

        <item>HEARING AND REFLEX ACTION ESSAY<br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

Explain how a person hears the sound of a
dog growling and is able to respond rapidly
to the touch of its nose on his or her leg<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*HEARING<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

- When the person hears the sound of a dog
growling,<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

- The pinna traps and directs the sound
waves into the auditory canal<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-The sound waves strike the tympanic
membrane (eardrum) and causes it to
vibrate<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
- The vibrating membrane causes the<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Ossicles, including the stirrup (stapes), to
vibrate<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

- This sets up waves in the perilymph and
endolymph<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

- The organ of Corti in the cochlea becomes
stimulated<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
- The stimulus is converted to a nerve
The nerve impulse is carried by the
auditory nerve to the  cerebrum where the sound is interpreted <br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-The pressure in the cochlea is then eased
out through the round window into the Eustacian tube<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*REFLEX ACTION<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Reflex action may be defined as a rapid,
automatic response to a stimulus received
by an organ,in this case, the leg
-when the dogs nose touches the leg<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Receptors in the skin receive the stimulus
 The stimulus is converted into a nerve<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-The  impulse travel along the sensory neuron<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-towards the spinal cord along the dorsal
root<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-of the spinal nerve<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-in the spinal cord, the sensory neuron
makes synaptic contact with the connector
and then the impulses are transmitted
along the motor neuron along the ventral
root of the spinal nerve to the effector
organ/muscle which contracts and pulls the
leg away</item>
        <item>LAMARCKISM AND DARWINISM ESSAY<br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

Charles Darwin and Jean Baptiste de Lamarck had different ideas to explain
evolution. Describe how each of them would have explained the evolution of
the long necks of giraffes. Justify whose idea is more acceptable in the
science community today.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*Charles Darwin explanation<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-As a result of genetic variation / some giraffes have longer necks than
others<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Environmental change / when the leaves became scarce in short trees<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-competition for resources occurrred<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-causing those with shorter necks to die<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-and those with longer necks to survive<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-This is natural selection /survival of the fittest<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-The genes /genotype for longer necks<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-were passed on to subsequent generations<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-as a result now the population of giraffe have long necks<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>


*Jean Baptiste de Lamarck explanation<br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-All giraffes had short necks originally<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-When the leaves became scarce in short trees lower parts of trees<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Giraffes stretched / used their neck more often to reach to the taller trees<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-As a result the neck became longer / developed<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-This acquired characteristic was passed on to the offspring<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-The next generation of giraffes had long necks<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*An idea accepted in the science community today<br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Charles Darwin - there is evidence that genes are inherited from the
parents,and is not the acquired characteristics

Homeostasis is the maintenance of a constant
internal environment, within narrow limits, despite a
 changing external environment

Nomsa is sitting in class on a particular day and
looks at the wall thermometer showing 430C.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>


Discuss the processes and mechanisms that are
involved in thermoregulation and osmoregulation in
her body on that particular day.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*THERMOREGULATION<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-When the environmental temperature is high,
receptors in the skin detect this
increased blood temperature is detected by the
heat loss centre of the hypothalamus<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-The hypothalamus sends impulses to the skin
causing the surface blood vessels to dilate/increase
in diameter/vasodilation occurs<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-More blood flows to the skin and therefore more
heat is lost to the environment.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-The sweat glands are stimulated to produce more
sweat thereby causing heat loss through evaporation
Thereby causing the body to cool down<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>


*OSMOREGULATION<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-On a hot day a person loses water through
sweating, thereby decreasing the amount of water in
the blood.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Osmoreceptors detect this and cause the
hypothalamus to release more ADH (Antidiuretic
hormone) into the blood.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-ADH cause an increase in the permeability of the
renal tubules to water<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-More water is reabsorbed in the kidneys<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Urine becomes more concentrated/decrease in
volume<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Water levels are restored to normal

            BLOOD GROUPS ESSAY<br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

Sandy has given birth to a baby girl. There are two
men claiming to be the father of the child. Explain
how the inheritance of blood groups and DNA testing
could assist in establishing who the father is.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Blood groups are controlled by three alleles IA,
IB,i which in combination will provide four different
phenotypes namely blood groups A, B, O and AB.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-An individual with blood group A ,will inherit one
allele from each parent and will therefore inherit a
genotype of either IAi or IA IA from his parents<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-An individual with Blood group B will inherit one
allele from each parent and will therefore inherit
genotype of either 1Bi or 1BIB; and<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-An individual with blood group AB will inherit one
allele from each parent and will have both alleles IA
and IB which are co dominant, and<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-An individual with blood group O will inherit i allele<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-from both parents and will be homozygous recessive
(ii)<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-The blood of each male as well as the baby blood
must be tested.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-If the baby blood group is O, then the father with
blood group AB will be eliminated as he does not
cary the recessive O(i) allele.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Should the father have a blood group B with a IBIB
genotype, then he will be eliminated as a potential
father as he does not have the recessive O(i) allele.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Should the father have a blood group A with a IAIA
(homozygous) genotype , then he will be eliminated
as a potential father as he does not have the
recessive O(i) allele.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-The father who also has a blood group B but a
genotype of IBi (Heterozygous).could be a possible
father as he is carrying the i allele of which the baby
inherited<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-If the father who has a blood group A with
genotype of IAi, could be a possible father as
carrying the i allele of which the baby inherited.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-DNA testing can further confirm the father of the
child by analysing and comparing the DNA genetic
bands of each potential male parent with the genetic
bands of DNA taken from the baby.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Should there be more genetic bands that are
identical to that of the baby then that would confirm
the male parent/father.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-to form a ball of cells<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-called the morula<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-More mitotic divisions ot the morula occurs to form a hollow bal ot cells<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-called a blastocyst<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-The blastocyst attaches to the endometrial lining<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-The outer wall ot the blastocyst. called the chorion<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-develops projections called villi which<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-embeds/implants into the uterine wall<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-The cells of the embryo continues to divide<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-and differentiate<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-to form the different organs and limbs<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-and is now called a foetus<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-The foetus is enclosed in a sac called the amnion<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-filled with amniotic fluid<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-which protects the foetus against temperature fluctuations<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-protects the foetus against dehydration<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-and protects the foetus against mechanical injury/acts as a shock absorber<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>



-The chorionic vili and the endometrium form the placenta<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-where the blood ot both the foetus and the mother<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-run close to each other<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-allowing lor nutrients to diffuse/ into the blood of the foetus<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*Hormone in human reproduction.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Testosterone<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Produced by seminiferous tubules in the testes<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Produced by the Graafian follicles<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-in the ovaries<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Causes the lining of the uterus / endometrium<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-to become thicker/more vascular<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-in preparation for a possible implantation of the embryo and development of the

GRADUALISM VS PUNTCUATED EQULIBRIUM)<br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

Evolution according to Lamarck<br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*Lamarck explained evolution using the following two laws:<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*The law of use and disuse<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-As an organism uses a structure or organ more regularly, it becomes
better developed or enlarged in that organism<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-If an organism does not use a structure or organ frequently, it becomes
less developed or reduced in size and may disappear altogether in that
organism<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*The inheritance of acquired characteristics<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Characteristics developed during the ito of an individual<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-(Acquired characteristics) can be passed on to other offspring<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>


*Evolution according to Darwin<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Organisms produce a large number of offspring<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-There is a great deal of variation amongst thë offspring<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Some have favourable characteristics<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
and some do not
-When there is a change in the environmental conditions/or<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
there is competition
-Then organisms with characteristics which are more favourable survive<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-This organism with less favourable characteristics die<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-This is called natural selection<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-The organisms that survive reproduce<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-And this pass on the favourable characteristics to their offspring<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-The next generation will therefore have a higher proportion of individuals<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
with the favourable characteristics<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*Darwins ideas about gradualism compared to Punctuated Equilibrium<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Darwin believed that evolution takes place through an<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-accumulation of small<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-gradual  changes that occur over a long period of time<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-supported by transitional forms in fossil record<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Punctuated equilibrium suggested that evolution sometimes involves long<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-periods of time where species do not change /very little change occurs<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-This alternates with short periods of time where rapid changes occur<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-New species are formed in a short period of time /relative to the long<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-period of no/little change<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-supported by the absence of transitional forms
</item>
        <item>PUNCTUATED EQUILIBRIUM VS GRADUALISM <br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*GRADUALISM <br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Based on Geology and the findings of James Hutton and Charles Lyell, gradualism is the idea that large changes are
actually he culmination very small changes that build up over time<br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-This is seen often  geological- processes and when Charles Darwin first began formulating Theory of Evolution,he
adopted this idea for how evolution happens over very longtime periods.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-The fossil record is a piece of evidence that view.The are many transitional solution fossils that show
structural adaptation of species as they transform into new species.The geologist time scale helps show how the species
have changed over the different eras since life began on earth.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*PUNCTUATED EQUILIBRIUM<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>



-The other generally accepted hypothesis for the rate of evolution is called punctuated equilibrium <br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
Punctuated equilibrium is based on the idea that we cannot see changes in a species so there mast be very long periods
of no changes of species.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-That is he equilibrium part of punctuated equilibrium.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-However, we do know that species do change, so there has to be a period of time where those changes occur.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Punctuated equilibrium asserts these changes over a relatively short amount of time punctuating(the long periods of
equilibrium).

-Describe how POINT MUTATIONS, FRAMESHIFT MUTATIONS and MEIOSIS contribute to Genetic Variation
GENE MUTATIONS<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Gene mutations are errors (or mistakes or changes) that may occur during tanscription and /or DNA replication<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-POINT MUTATIONS:replacing/substituting  one base of a codon with another<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Small change that may possibly result in one amino acid changing in protein<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-FRAMESHIFT-MUTATIONS: addition/ deletion of one or more bases of a code<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Resulting in changing the order/ sequence of all the bases of the codons J<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Resulting in forming a different protein with different functions<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Lead to different phenotypes<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*MEOSIS<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*CROSSING-OVER<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Homologous chromosomes/bivalents pair up<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Each chromosome has 2 chromatids<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Non-sister chromatids  overlap/cross-over<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Points at which crossing-over takes place are referred to as chiasmata<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Genetic material is exchanged between non-sister chromatids<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-After the process of crossing over chromosomes have alleles from its homologous partner<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-This means that each gamete formed wl have a max of alleles tom beth parents<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Brings about variation in the gametes formed and also the offspring<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*RANDOM ARRANGEMENT OF CHROMOSOMES AT THE EQUATOR <br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Each pair of homologous chromosomes may ine up either way up on the equator of the spindle<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Independently of what the other pairs are doing<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-This means that gametes will have differing number/mix  of both parental chromosomes </item>
        <item>FOETUS ESSAY<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

An unicellular zygote undergoes many developmental changes it becomes a multicellular foetus, nourished and
protected by the mother.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

Describe changes that allow the ZYGOTE TO EVENTUALLY DEVELOP INTO A FOETUS and how te FOETUS IS
NOURISHED AND PROTECTED DURING THE PERIOD OF PREGNANCY<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*DEVELOPMENT OF AN UNICELLULAR ZYGOTE<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

Just after the fertilisation, a zygote is formed. The zygote passes down the fallopian tube and undergoes col division
mitosis<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

The zygote developing into a ball f cells called morula and thereafter  it becomes blastocyte. In teurus it
will further divide by mitosis and form an embryo, which becomes attached to the endometriam wall of the uterus. This is
called implantation. During this time two membranes develop around it.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

They are called extra-embryonic membranes.The membranes are the chorion which form the choronic villi and the
amnion After 12 weeks, the embryo is called a foetus.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*NOURISHMENT OF THE FOETUS<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
The foetus is nourished by the mother through the placenta. Nutrients and compounds from the maternal blood pass into
the foetal blood. These substances feed the foetus via the umbilical vein.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*PROTECTION OF THE FOETUS<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
The foetus is protected by the amnion filled with an amniotic fluid which prevents temperature charges as well as against
injury-it acts as a shock absorber</item>

*Significance<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-This represents a change from quadrupedalism in ape-lie beings<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-To bipedalism/(walking upright) in modern humans,leading to the following in modern humans<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Humans have smaller jaws than the ape-like beings<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Humans have jaws that are non-prognathous/ flat face compared to the jaws of ape- like beings which are
-prognathous/sloping face<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Humans have C-shaped jaws /jaws that are gently curved compared to the U shaped jaws in the ape-like beings<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*Significance<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-This corresponds with a change in diet from hard raw food in the ape-like beings<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-To softer cooked food in humans<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*Dentition/Teeth<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-In ape-like beings there are gaps/diastema between incisors and canines<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-but no gasp between the teeth in humans<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Humans have smaller teeth incisors and canines than the ape-like beings<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Humans  have flatter molars and pre-molars than the ape-like beings<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*Significance<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-This corresponds with the decreased need to bite and tea and an increased need to grind and chew in humans in
-view of the change in diet to soft cooked food.<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*Eyebrow ridges<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Humans have eyebrow ridge that are smaller than those of the ape-like beings<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*Significance<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>


-There is a decreased need to strengthen the skull of humans due to the smaller size of the jaws<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*Chin<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-In humans e chin is more developed  compared to the ape-like beings<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-Developed chin assists with speechSin humans (space in mouth for movement of tongue for the development of complicated language)<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

*Zygomatic arch<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>

-In humans the zygomatic arch/cheek bone is less developed than in the ape- like beings<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
*Significance<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-The corresponds with the decreased need tor attachment of strong muscles due to the decreased jaw size in humans<br> \n</br><br> \n</br>
-Also, jaw muscles not as big and strong which indicates omnivores diet. They eat more fined food(cooked meat and vegetables)
